# Portfolio

> A portfolio website showcasing the projects I have worked on during my free time and part of my education.

This portfolio website was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Sass. This project was an excellent opportunity to put my design and technical skills to the test.

The portfolio website [is currently being hosted and can be accessed here.](https://abasher-portfolio-xg7by.ondigitalocean.app/)
